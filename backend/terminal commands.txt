---- Setting up Postgres through trial and error -----
Open psql on Windows:
& "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin\psql.exe" -U postgres
(Make sure C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin is added to PATH environment variables)

(I'm not actually using db and usr, they're placeholders)

In Postgres:
CREATE DATABASE db;
CREATE USER usr WITH PASSWORD 'pwd';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE db TO usr;

Connect to a db:
\c db

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA public TO user;
ALTER USER usr CREATEDB;
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO usr;
